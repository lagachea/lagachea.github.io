# Welcome to my portfolio
I am Alexandre Lagache a software developer from France.
I like to work with Python and C to design some simple solutions to complex problems.
You can find the rest of my work on my github [page](https://github.com/lagachea), or you're more interested in my [resume](https://github.com/lagachea/lagachea.github.io/CV).

### [Inception_of_things](https://github.com/plagache/inception_of_things)
_from febuary 2023 to november 2023_

This project is a minimal introduction to Kubernetes.
This project aims to deepen our knowledge of system administration by using K3s and K3d as well as Vagrant
What I learned during this project:
- Setup a virtual machine using vagrant
- Deploy applications inside a K3s instance
- Deploy an application inside git repo to a K3d cluster using argoCD

### [Datascience X Logistic Regression](https://github.com/plagache/DSLR)
_from june 2023 to present_

This goal of is to implement a linear classification model with logistic regression.
We are tasked to recreate the Sorting Hat of Hogwarts: it was used to determine which of the four school Houses was the best fit for each new student.
What I learned during this project:
- How to perform a logistic regression on a given dataset
- What is a classifier and how to build one
- Work with matrix multiplication in Python

### [Linear Regression](https://github.com/lagachea/linear-regression)
_from november 2020 to may 2023_

The aim of this project is to introduce to the basic concept behind machine learning.
Here we create a program that predicts the price of a car by using a linear function train with a gradient descent algorithm.
What I learned during this project:
- How to perform a gradient descent
- How to plot data using matplotlib

### [Ft_ping](https://github.com/lagachea/ft_ping)
_from november 2022 to may 2023_

This project is about recoding the ping command.
Ping is the name of a command that allows to test the accessibility of another machine through the IP network. The command measures also the time taken to receive a response, called round-trip time.
What I learned during this project:
- Create and handle IP and ICMP packets from scratch
- Send and recieve packet using a raw socket
- Work with real time network operations
