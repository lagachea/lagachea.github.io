	<h2><a href="https://github.com/plagache/inception_of_things">Inception_of_things</a></h2>
	<p><cite>from febuary 2023 to november 2023</cite></p>
	<p>This project is a minimal introduction to Kubernetes.</p>
	<p>This project aims to deepen our knowledge of system administration by using K3s and K3d as well as Vagrant</p>
	<p>What I learned during this project:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Setup a virtual machine using vagrant</li>
		<li>Deploy applications inside a K3s instance</li>
		<li>Deploy an application inside git repo to a K3d cluster using argoCD</li>
	</ul>

	<h2><a href="https://github.com/plagache/DSLR">Datascience X Logistic Regression</a></h2>
	<p><cite>from june 2023 to november 2023</cite></p>
	<p>This goal of is to implement a linear classification model with logistic regression.</p>
	<p>We are tasked to recreate the Sorting Hat of Hogwarts: it was used to determine which of the four school Houses was the best fit for each new student.</p>
	<p>What I learned during this project:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>How to perform a logistic regression on a given dataset</li>
		<li>What is a classifier and how to build one</li>
		<li>Work with matrix multiplication in Python</li>
	</ul>

	<h2><a href="https://github.com/lagachea/linear-regression">Linear Regression</a></h2>
	<p><cite>from november 2020 to may 2023</cite></p>
	<p>The aim of this project is to introduce to the basic concept behind machine learning.</p>
	<p>Here we create a program that predicts the price of a car by using a linear function train with a gradient descent algorithm.</p>
	<p>What I learned during this project:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>How to perform a gradient descent</li>
		<li>How to plot data using matplotlib</li>
	</ul>

	<h2><a href="https://github.com/lagachea/ft_ping">Ft_ping</a></h2>
	<p><cite>from november 2022 to may 2023</cite></p>
	<p>This project is about recoding the ping command.</p>
	<p>Ping is the name of a command that allows to test the accessibility of another machine through the IP network. The command measures also the time taken to receive a response, called round-trip time.</p>
	<p>What I learned during this project:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Create and handle IP and ICMP packets from scratch</li>
		<li>Send and recieve packet using a raw socket</li>
		<li>Work with real time network operations</li>
	</ul>
